# EmployeeSelection
Java based employee selection. 

The employee is generated by the number: 1, 2, 3 (consecutive frontend employee, backend employee and fullstack employee).
Now, every employee have their own token (maybe this is same as their salary) and I generate this by number from 1 to 9.

The selection is :
  1. Checking whether he/she is frontend or backend or fullstack
  2. If fullstack, he/she will be get his/her own priority      
  3. if frontend and/or backend, check again whether who is the lowest token. they will be need as together (because frontend need backend and vice versa)
  4. Fullstack token will be compared by frontend and backend token
  5. if fullstack token > frontend+backend token, then fullstack is taken
  6. else frontend+backend is taken.
